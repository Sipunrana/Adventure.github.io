<pre>Another benefit of bike riding via commute is 
once you’re in the habit of getting to work by bike, 
you’ll be better prepared for what comes next, such as opting for 
your bike over your car to run a quick errand on the weekend or riding 
to the gym. Daily exercise has been found to increase energy 
and reduce fatigue. Even a single 30-minute bout of exercise 
can improve reaction time, memory, and creative thinking.
“Cycling is one of the best exercises I’d recommend,” says 
Corey Kunzer, a physical therapist and supervisor for the 
Mayo Clinic’s sports medicine department. “It’s easy on the joints 
and helps relieve stress.” Cycling has also been found to reduce 
anxiety and depression. When given a questionnaire, men who 
increased their daily bike commuting saw improvements in 
their overall mental health.All that newfound mental health 
could result in newfound confidence—which may or may not be 
a good thing. Men who exercise six or seven days per 
week have been found to self-report their sexual desirability 
as above average, or much above average.There’s at least some 
reason, however, for them to think so highly of themselves.
Exercise has been shown to lead to increased sexual drive 
and decreases in sexual dysfunction, to a point. Too much of a 
good thing can drive down testosterone levels in men, but just 20 minutes 
of vigorous exercise can make women more sexually responsive.
